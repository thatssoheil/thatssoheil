## About

I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with a **5-year track record** specializing in **React.js** and **Next.js**. I transform designs into dynamic, high-quality user experiences — bridging the gap between design intent and technical execution. My career journey began in backend development, but a drive for immediate, tangible results led me to the frontend world where I've been ever since.

I care deeply about clean architecture, pixel-perfect implementation, and user-centered development. Whether contributing to early-stage startups or established product teams, I bring technical rigor and collaborative energy to every project.
