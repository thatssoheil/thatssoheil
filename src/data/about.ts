    "I'm Soheil Fakour — a Senior Frontend Developer with a 5-year track record of turning ambitious designs into polished, production-ready web experiences. My core toolkit is React and Next.js, but my obsession is the craft itself: pixel-perfect UI, clean architecture, and interactions that feel effortless.",
    "I've shipped products across the full spectrum — from early-stage startups and B2C consumer apps to enterprise B2B platforms, CRM tools for US realtors, and a social-learning platform that fuses LinkedIn and Coursera. Every context has shaped how I think about scale, usability, and code quality.",
    "My background began in backend development, which gives me a rare full-picture perspective. I joined frontend because I love seeing immediate, tangible results — and I haven't looked back since.",
